2022/03/04,14:00,18:30,4:30,Set up repository; collected data on each BFG; began development of Arduino/RPi interface
2022/03/09,00:00,03:30,3:30,set up arduino_cli and relevant libraries for arduino compiling on pi; implemented BFGs in backend code
2022/03/09,11:30,14:30,3:00,Finished arduino-side serial comms (json deserialize and reserialize)
2022/03/09,20:00,21:30,1:30,Python BFG update system implemented
2022/03/12,16:30,17:30,1:00,Documentation and library collection on all remaining non-BFG devices
2022/03/13,11:30,14:00,2:30,Imported remaining libraries; began implementing non-bfg arduino devices; documentation updates
2022/03/13,20:30,21:30,1:00,Completed remaining devices on the Arduino; arduino is ready for testing
2022/03/16,11:00,13:00,2:00,"Migrated compilation and uploading protocols to Windows, from Linux"
2022/03/16,15:00,19:00,4:00,Tested arduino-side json processing; optimized arduino memory usage; fixed bug with packing responses; reworked device initializations; started python data collection testing
2022/03/16,10:00,11:59,2:00,Finished pi-side json processing; serial comms need to be sped up
2022/03/23,13:00,17:00,4:00,Three devices now communicating; rest should be easy
2022/03/24,19:00,22:00,3:00,"Rewired test bench, expanded Devices header"
2022/04/01,00:00,03:00,3:00,"Remainder of devices tested individually. Multiplexer backend created, there were some device conflicts when combining devices."
2022/04/02 - 2022/04/03,18:00,01:00,7:00,"All devices now communicating, in any combination. Load testing done. CSV logging implemented properly. Almost ready to deploy."
